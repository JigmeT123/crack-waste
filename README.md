# Crack Waste.

# Inspiration:

While seeing a lot of waste being uncollected, the society and the community that we live in looks very untidy and unhygienic. Having all age group in the community, wastes being left uncollected would have made kids, elderly people, and everyone else prone to illness. Seeing this issue and taking into consideration the job done by the municipality, we came up with this web app – crackWaste!

# What it does
crackWaste helps keep track of the waste that is being collected. In an area with many communities, it is very hard to know whether the trash is being picked up or not. Using crackWaste, we can have the collector (or ourselves) scan a QR Code which will lead to the web app where the user can put in their details and it’ll record the date and time of the disposal.
